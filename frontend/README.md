## Frontend

To run the front-end for development:

`yarn run start`

To build the front-end:

`yarn run build`

Building will generate files in the `dist` directory.  One of the files is a `manifest.json` file that contains references to all the assets that were built.

The root already does this for you so you may not need to run these commands.
